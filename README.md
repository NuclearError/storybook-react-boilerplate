# storybook-react-boilerplate
Storybook boilerplate set up for React, providing example components

This boilerplate was set up following [the steps documented here](https://storybook.js.org/basics/guide-react/).

## Get it running

Clone this repo and run the following from the project's root:

```
npm install
npm run storybook
```

You should now be able to view the storybook boilerplate in the browser at [http://localhost:9001/](http://localhost:9001/).

The boilerplate contains a simple 'SearchApp' - this is an input field that repeats the input string on the page. No actual search action is performed.
